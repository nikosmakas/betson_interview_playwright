=========================================================

Project Structure & Architecture

The repository is structured in a modular way to clearly separate UI and API test concerns:


UI Tests use the Page Object Model for abstraction.

API Tests utilize Playwrightâ€™s built-in request API.

Utilities and test data are extracted into their own folders to keep tests clean and maintainable.

(After getting an existing pet by id e.g. status: available -> sold)

Endpoint 2: store
Test Scenarios:

GET /store/inventory    Returns a map of status codes to quantities

POST /store/order   Place an order for a pet

GET /store/order/{orderId}  Find purchace order by ID 
(maybe find the one I created in the post scenario)
